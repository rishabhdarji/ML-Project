# Netflix Titles Dataset Analysis

## About the Dataset

Netflix, one of the biggest names in media and video streaming, offers over 8000 films and TV shows to a global audience of 200 million subscribers. This project uses the Netflix Titles dataset, which provides detailed information about the movies and TV shows available on the platform, including details like cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, and genre.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains comprehensive information about Netflix's offerings, including movies and TV shows. It includes key attributes like title, type (movie or TV show), director, cast, country of origin, release year, rating, and a brief description.

### Key Columns:
- `show_id`: A unique identifier for each title.
- `type`: The type of the title (movie or TV show).
- `title`: The name of the movie or TV show.
- `director`: The director(s) of the title.
- `cast`: The list of main actors/actresses.
- `country`: The country or countries where the movie/show was produced.
- `date_added`: The date the title was added to Netflix.
- `release_year`: The year the title was released.
- `rating`: Age classification for the title.
- `duration`: The duration of the movie in minutes, or the number of seasons for TV shows.
- `listed_in`: Genres the title belongs to.
- `description`: A brief summary of the title.

## Key Statistics

- **Total Entries**: 8809 (movies and TV shows)
- **Columns**: 12 columns representing various details of the titles.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Dataset Exploration

1. **Loading the Dataset**:  
The dataset is loaded using pandas `read_csv()` method.

```python
import pandas as pd
data_frame = pd.read_csv("netflix_titles.csv")
```

2. **Checking for Missing Data**:  
A heatmap is used to visualize missing values in the dataset.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(9, 8))
sns.heatmap(data_frame.isnull())
plt.show()
```

3. **Exploring Data**:  
We explore the leading movie producers (countries) and the distribution of movies vs TV shows in the dataset.

```python
leading_movie_producers = data_frame.country.value_counts().nlargest(20)
```

4. **Distribution of Content**:  
A pie chart is used to compare the counts of movies and TV shows.

```python
plt.pie(data_counts, autopct='%.2f%%', textprops={'fontsize': 14})
```

5. **Yearly Content Distribution**:  
A line chart and bar plots are created to show the distribution of movies and TV shows by release year.

```python
data_frame['release_year'].value_counts().sort_index().plot(kind='line')
```

## Visualizations

- **Top Movie Producers**:  
  A bar chart showing the top 20 countries producing Netflix content.

- **Movies vs TV Shows**:  
  A pie chart comparing the distribution of movies and TV shows on Netflix.

- **Content Distribution Over the Years**:  
  A line chart displaying the yearly count of titles added to Netflix.

- **Director Analysis**:  
  A bar plot showing the most prolific directors in the dataset for movies.

```python
top_directors_by_movie_type = Movie.groupby('director')['type'].value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False).head(15)
```

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the distribution of content on Netflix, the impact of movie producers, and the trends in movie and TV show releases over time. The dataset helps to understand the evolution of Netflix's content library, both in terms of quantity and diversity.
